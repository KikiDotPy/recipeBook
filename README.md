## How to Add a New Recipe

If you’d like to contribute a recipe to the Recipe Book, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Locate the section where recipes are defined, inside the `<main>` tag.

3. Copy and paste the following template at the appropriate place in the file, adjusting the content for your new recipe:

    ```html
    <!-- Page X -->
    <article class="page" aria-labelledby="recipe-title-X">
      <div class="page-content">
        <h2 id="recipe-title-X">[Recipe Name]</h2>
        <div class="stamp" aria-hidden="true">Certified by X</div>
        <div class="ingredients">
          <h3 class="section-title">Ingredients:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>[Ingredient 1]</li>
            <li>[Ingredient 2]</li>
            <li>[Ingredient 3]</li>
            <!-- Add as many ingredients as needed -->
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
          <h3 class="section-title">Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>[Step 1]</li>
            <li>[Step 2]</li>
            <li>[Step 3]</li>
            <!-- Add as many steps as needed -->
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
    ```

4. Replace:
   - `[Recipe Name]` with the title of your recipe.
   - `[Ingredient 1], [Ingredient 2], [Ingredient 3]` with the list of ingredients.
   - `[Step 1], [Step 2], [Step 3]` with the step-by-step instructions for your recipe.
   - `X` with the next page number (e.g., `2` if the last recipe is `Page 1`).

5. Save your changes.

6. Preview the HTML file in a browser to ensure your recipe displays correctly.

7. Commit and push your changes to the repository. Make sure to describe your contribution in the commit message.

That’s it! Your recipe is now part of the JiTTers Recipe Book 🍾
